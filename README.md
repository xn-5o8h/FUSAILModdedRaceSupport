# FUSAILModdedRaceSupport
A bunch of patches to make sure modded species get FU's S.A.I.L. interface. It is made of way too many patches for all the techstations, an includes array of all the patched mods, and a priority 2 just in case.

Will try to have it updated with the workshop at least weekly, but feel free to request a mod by commenting on the Steam page, posting an issue here or whatever. If possible, I'd prefer if you could post a link to the steam workshop.

Currently in test phase, no steam workshop / chucklefish forum download links for now.

To install, download the archive, unzip, and place the folder "FUSAILModdedRaceSupport" you find inside into /Starbound/mods. (This is to avoid having useless git files in the steam / cf uploads.)
